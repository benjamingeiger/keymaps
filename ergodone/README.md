For each layer:

* Go to the "Raw Data" tab, choose "Upload JSON", then choose the JSON file
  corresponding to that layer.

* Select the entirety of the data listed in the box above the button, copy it,
  and paste it into the corresponding layer box on the TKG site.

Once the layers are loaded, go to the "Tools" menu and choose "Import Fn".
